this is a placeholder repository for a work in progress discord bot (which i am primarly making for just friends but once it is functional i'll release the source code here for if anyone else might find it useful)

written in golang, using the disgord library [github.com/andersfylling/disgord](disgord)

~~estimated date of functionality: hopefullyi functional by december and usable before the end of 2018~~
that didn't happen so hopefully functional by april 2019
