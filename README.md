EDIT: added some really really early wip code for the sake of helping with a bug report for disgord

this is a placeholder repository for a work in progress discord bot (which i am primarly making for just friends but once it is functional i'll release the source code here for if anyone else might find it useful)

written in golang, using the disgord library [github.com/andersfylling/disgord](https://github.com/andersfylling/disgord)

~~estimated date of functionality: hopefullyi functional by december and usable before the end of 2018~~
~~that didn't happen so hopefully functional by april 2019~~ (project on hold)

edit: project put on hold until further notice, i'll be focusing on other projects for now

if i decide to continue this one i'll most likely end up rewriting everything due to how the code in this is a total mess and is full of newbie mistakes that i don't feel like fixing (i was learning pretty basic stuff while writing the code seen here) 
the repo's at [https://github.com/Dustyvf/wipDiscordBot](wipDiscordBot) and [https://github.com/Dustyvf/TBCBot](TBCBot) are much more recent, and for the time being the latter (tbcbot) is going to be my main focus
